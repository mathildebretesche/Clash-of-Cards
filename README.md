## Overview

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the **SUI Blockchain**. It is a fully on-chain trading card game where players can collect, trade, and open packs of digital cards.

This repository was created for the **DV Blockchain SUI Hackathon** in Paris, developed in partnership with **SUI** and the **Institute of Future Technology**.

## Key Features

- **NFT Marketplace**: A decentralized market where players can buy packs.
- **Random Packs**: Buying a pack generates a verifiable random card from the game collection using SUI's on-chain randomness.
- **Full Ownership**: All cards are minted as NFTs on the SUI blockchain, ensuring true ownership.
- **P2P Exchange**: Players can trade or exchange their NFT cards with others directly on-chain.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) (TypeScript)
- **Smart Contracts**: [SUI Move](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts)
- **Tooling**: `pnpm`, `Sui dApp Kit`
